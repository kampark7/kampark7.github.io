  - [Baysian Probability & Inference - R](https://github.com/kampark7/CodeProjectsandCoursework/blob/master/PrincipalsofDataScienceinR/Homeworks/Homework%209%20-%20Bayes%20Probability%20and%20Inference(1).rmd)
  - [Monte Carlo Simulation - R](https://github.com/kampark7/CodeProjectsandCoursework/blob/master/PrincipalsofDataScienceinR/Homeworks/Homework%209%20-%20Bayes%20Probability%20and%20Inference(1).rmd)

* Machine Learning
  - [Logistic Regression- Python](https://github.com/kampark7/CodeProjectsandCoursework/blob/master/IntroToMachineLearning/homework5/hw5.ipynb)
  - [MLB All-Star Predictor Project - Python](https://github.com/kampark7/CodeProjectsandCoursework/blob/master/IntroToMachineLearning/finalproject/finalproject.ipynb)
    Takes in rookie player stats (since 1947) and attempts to predict if they will be an all-star or not.

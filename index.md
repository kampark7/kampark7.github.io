  - [Baysian Probability & Inference - R](https://github.com/kampark7/CodeProjectsandCoursework/blob/master/PrincipalsofDataScienceinR/Homeworks/Homework%209%20-%20Bayes%20Probability%20and%20Inference(1).rmd)
  - [Monte Carlo Simulation - R](https://github.com/kampark7/CodeProjectsandCoursework/blob/master/PrincipalsofDataScienceinR/Homeworks/Homework%209%20-%20Bayes%20Probability%20and%20Inference(1).rmd)
  - [Statistical Significance of Oscar Nominated Movie Ratings - Python](https://github.com/kampark7/kampark7.github.io/blob/master/coursework/MovieSignificance.ipynb)

### Machine Learning
  - [MLB All-Star Predictor Project - Python](https://github.com/kampark7/CodeProjectsandCoursework/blob/master/IntroToMachineLearning/finalproject/finalproject.ipynb)
    Takes in rookie player stats (since 1947) and attempts to predict if they will be an all-star or not.
  - [Decision Tree Classifier - Python](https://github.com/kampark7/CodeProjectsandCoursework/blob/master/IntroToMachineLearning/homework6/Homework6.ipynb)
  - [Multi-Class Classification Analysis - Python](https://github.com/kampark7/kampark7.github.io/blob/master/coursework/MultiClassClassification.ipynb)
  - [Logistic Regression- Python](https://github.com/kampark7/CodeProjectsandCoursework/blob/master/IntroToMachineLearning/homework5/hw5.ipynb)
  - [Idaho Food Bank - R](https://github.com/kampark7/CodeProjectsandCoursework/blob/master/StatisticalModelinginR/Project3/Project3.Rmd) and [Write-Up](https://github.com/kampark7/CodeProjectsandCoursework/blob/master/StatisticalModelinginR/Project3/Project3WriteUp.pdf) Attempts to model most popular times people visit a local food banck for different services.
  - [Predicting House Prices - R](https://github.com/kampark7/CodeProjectsandCoursework/blob/master/StatisticalModelinginR/Project4/Project4.Rmd) Takes in housing data and uses Lasso Regression to predict how much the house should be listed for.

### Technical Writing
  - [Explainability of One Class Classification Models](https://github.com/kampark7/kampark7.github.io/blob/master/coursework/Explainability_of_One_Class_Classification_Anomalous_Text_Detection_Models.pdf) Deep Learning course final project paper. Studies One Class Classification Anomalous Text Detection Models and attempts to use machine learning to explain the decisions the model makes.
